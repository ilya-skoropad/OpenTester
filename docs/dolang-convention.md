# Namings
## Folder names
### Subprojects
Folders for subprojects should have the structure
`{project prefix}.{type prefix}.name`.

Every single letter 
in the name should be in the lower case. Instead of spaces 
the underscore (`_`) sign should be used.

**Examples**: 
1. op.api.main
2. op.api.user_reg
3. op.front.main
4. op.docs

### Folders
Names of folders should be written in snake case.

Names that consists of one word only are much more preferable than others.

### Files
Names of files should be written in Pascal case.
